 <p><strong>Canon:</strong> This represents the type of episode that is a one-to-one recreation of the manga, which therefore
    represents the original creator's ideas.
    
  </p>
  <p><strong>Filler:</strong> This represents the type of episode that is not a product of the orignal manga author, it is the 
    creation of the animation studio and is predominantly irrelevant to the story and treated as such by the 
    canon material and fans. </p>

  <p><strong>Side note:</strong> Some episodes were a mixture of filler and canon material, but were counted as filler both to 
    reduce confusion and make sure that the canon material was the original work of the author only
